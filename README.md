In this project, We are going to get our hands on two awesome products from Dragino which are the LPS-8 and the LGT-92. The LPS-8 is the LoRaWAN Gateway from Dragino which is an 8 channel Gateway which can handle multiple number of LoRa nodes simultaneously. With this gateway, we have LGT-92 GPS Tracker node. This node is a LoRa based GPS tracker which has an SX1276 LoRa module and a 9-axis accelerometer by the help of which the node gives accurate location data. The LGT-92 also has an emergency alarm button which can send emergency signal to the Gateway when needed.

After getting a detailed look we will also make a project using these. We will be connecting the LGT-92 GPS Tracker node and an Arduino based GPS tracker node to the Dragino Gateway and send the location data to the Gateway. We will be using TheThingsNetwork Platform as the Server for our Project where we will create an application for the project add our device to it and after that receive data on that as well. As the nodes are kept indoors there must be some delay in receptence but keeping the nodes in open help in enhancing its performance.
